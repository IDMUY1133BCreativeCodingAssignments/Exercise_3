### Exercise 3: Repetition: Modularity, Pattern 

Using 1 form/shape and create 3 different grid patterns. Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. 

Some things to consider: 

- You could use a few shapes to make one shape, then to repeat that.
- How could you skip a line or value? Check out modulo - %
- How could you intergate interactivity/ state changes?
- Go to town with color, lerp and map!
- Think: crazy wall paper


Have fun, and experiment!
